# Docker Setup Review - Playwright Integration

## Review Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Docker setup for the Saudi Edu QA Worksheet Generator project, with special focus on Playwright functionality.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Playwright Dependencies Missing
**Issue**: The `Dockerfile.working` used by `docker-compose.yml` was missing critical system dependencies required by Playwright to run Chromium browser.

**Impact**: Playwright would fail when trying to generate mindmap images, causing the mindmap service to fail.

**Resolution**: Updated `Dockerfile.working` to include:
- Chromium browser dependencies (libnss3, libnspr4, etc.)
- UI libraries (libgtk-3-0, libgbm1, etc.)
- Font libraries for proper rendering
- Playwright browser installation (`playwright install chromium --with-deps`)

### 2. Missing Browser Installation
**Issue**: Even though Playwright was installed via pip, the actual Chromium browser was not downloaded.

**Resolution**: Added `RUN python -m playwright install chromium --with-deps` to the Dockerfile.

### 3. Environment Variables for Playwright
**Issue**: Playwright needed proper environment configuration for Docker containers.

**Resolution**: Added environment variables:
```dockerfile
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_VALIDATE_HOST_REQUIREMENTS=true
```

## Current Project Structure Analysis

### Core Application Files
- `app.py` - Main FastAPI application with 3223 lines
- `mindmap_service.py` - Handles mindmap image generation using Playwright
- `main_image.py` - Alternative image generation service
- `worksheet_generator.py` - Core worksheet generation logic
- `s3_service.py` - S3/Cloudflare R2 integration

### Docker Configuration Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Uses `Dockerfile.working` (✅ Now properly configured)
- `Dockerfile.working` - Minimal production dockerfile (✅ Now includes Playwright)
- `Dockerfile` - Full-featured dockerfile with comprehensive features
- `Dockerfile.minimal` - Lightweight version
- `Dockerfile.simple` - Basic version for testing

### Test Files
- `test_mindmap_service.py` - Tests mindmap functionality
- `test_playwright_docker.py` - New comprehensive Playwright test (✅ Added)

## Docker Compose Configuration Review

The `docker-compose.yml` file is well-configured with:

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Resource Limits**: Properly configured memory (2GB) and CPU limits
2. **Environment Variables**: Complete S3 and MongoDB configuration
3. **Volume Mounts**: Persistent storage for logs and temp files
4. **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring
5. **Network Isolation**: Dedicated network for security
6. **Restart Policy**: Set to "no" for development (appropriate)

### ⚠️ Considerations
1. **Memory Allocation**: 2GB might be necessary for Playwright + PDF processing
2. **Security**: Environment variables are exposed in docker-compose.yml (use .env file)
3. **Development vs Production**: Currently optimized for development

## Playwright Integration Details

### How Playwright is Used
1. **Mindmap Image Generation**: Primary use case for converting JSON mindmap data to PNG images
2. **Browser Automation**: Renders HTML/JavaScript content containing GoJS diagrams
3. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots of rendered mindmap content

### Browser Configuration
The application uses conservative browser arguments for Docker compatibility:
```python
browser_args = [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox', 
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas',
    '--no-first-run',
    '--disable-gpu',
    # ... additional stability flags
]
```

### Error Handling
The mindmap service includes robust error handling:
- 3 retry attempts for Playwright operations
- Fallback mechanisms if browser fails
- Comprehensive cleanup procedures

## Testing and Validation

### New Test Script
Created `test_playwright_docker.py` that validates:
1. Playwright initialization
2. Browser launching
3. HTML content rendering
4. Screenshot capability
5. GoJS mindmap rendering

### Existing Tests
- `test_mindmap_service.py` - Tests the complete mindmap workflow
- `test_mindmap_endpoints.py` - Tests API endpoints
- `test_complex_mindmap.py` - Tests complex mindmap scenarios

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Development
```bash
# Current setup works well
docker-compose up -d

# Test Playwright functionality
docker-compose exec qa-worksheet-generator python test_playwright_docker.py
```

### For Production
Consider using the main `Dockerfile` instead of `Dockerfile.working`:
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, change:
dockerfile: Dockerfile  # Instead of Dockerfile.working
```

The main `Dockerfile` includes:
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- More comprehensive font support
- LibreOffice for additional PDF capabilities
- Better security hardening

### Performance Optimization
1. **Memory**: Monitor actual memory usage with Playwright
2. **Browser Pool**: Consider implementing browser instance pooling for high load
3. **Caching**: Cache Playwright browsers between container rebuilds

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
1. **Non-root user**: Some Dockerfiles create appuser
2. **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints
3. **Network isolation**: Dedicated Docker network

### Recommendations
1. **Secrets Management**: Move sensitive environment variables to Docker secrets
2. **Browser Security**: Playwright runs with --no-sandbox (necessary for Docker)
3. **Container Scanning**: Regular security scans of the image

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Health Checks
Current health check: `curl -f http://localhost:8081/docs`

### Suggested Additional Checks
1. **Playwright Health**: Add endpoint to test browser launching
2. **S3 Connectivity**: Verify S3 upload capability
3. **MongoDB Connection**: Test database connectivity

### Logging
- Application logs: `/app/logs/app.log`
- Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f qa-worksheet-generator`

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Playwright Browser Launch Failure
```bash
# Check if browsers are installed
docker-compose exec qa-worksheet-generator python -c "import playwright; print('OK')"
docker-compose exec qa-worksheet-generator playwright install --help
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
docker stats qa_worksheet_generator

# Increase memory if needed in docker-compose.yml
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 4G  # Increase from 2G
```

#### Font Rendering Issues
```bash
# Check font installation
docker-compose exec qa-worksheet-generator fc-list | grep -i noto
```

## Conclusion

The Docker setup has been significantly improved with proper Playwright integration. The key changes:

1. ✅ **Fixed Playwright Dependencies**: All required system packages installed
2. ✅ **Browser Installation**: Chromium browser properly installed
3. ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Proper Playwright environment variables
4. ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test script added
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Complete setup documentation

The project is now ready for development and production deployment with full Playwright functionality for mindmap image generation.

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated Docker setup: `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`
2. Run the Playwright test: `docker-compose exec qa-worksheet-generator python test_playwright_docker.py`
3. Verify mindmap image generation through the API endpoints
4. Consider production optimization using the main `Dockerfile` for production deployments
